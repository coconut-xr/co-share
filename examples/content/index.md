Javascript framework for easily building shared applications such as chats and games

`npm i co-share`

## **When to use**

Building **multiuser applications for the web** is often challenging as asynchronous communication can drastically increase the system complexity.
Writing **robust and performant shared applications** requires a structured and fitting architecture.

We propose the abstraction of **shared stores** to distribute logic and data between participating systems.
By using Javascript & Node.js, the same code can be used on the client and the server to carry out the **platform-independent communication**.

## [**Tutorial**](https://cocoss-org.github.io/co-share/counter)


We will build a globally synchronized counter and display it using `react`. Every client can increase the counter.

![Counter Example](counter-example.gif)

Above, you can see a local simulation with the clients "Alice" and "Bob". Even though we can simulate the communication locally, this library is meant for **networked communication** using WebSocket or WebRTC.

## [**Examples**](https://cocoss-org.github.io/co-share)

_The code for each example can be found on the respective pages_

### Simulated locally in your browser

<!-- * [Group Chat](https://cocoss-org.github.io/co-share/group-chat) - a whatsapp like chat implementation -->
-   [Message](https://cocoss-org.github.io/co-share/message) - direct client to client messaging without any persistent storage in between
-   [Lockable](https://cocoss-org.github.io/co-share/lockable) - advanced lock functionality to prevent editing by multiple people simultaneously
-   [Optimistic Lockable](https://cocoss-org.github.io/co-share/optimistic-lockable) - performance optimize lockable that allows for optimistic behaviour and error correction

### An extra Project with a server/client architecture using SocketIO

-   [Networked Counter using SocketIO](https://github.com/cocoss-org/co-share-socketio-counter-example) - just like the counter from the tutorial but with a server/client architecture using SocketIO
